As a pressed coin collector for 10+ years and a lifetime Disney fan, I dislike how there is no efficient and official way to keep trach of my coins through the official Disneyland app, or by printing a paper and manually checking them off. 

<b> What needs to be done: </b>
* Need to implement check boxes so that users can check off which coins they collected
* Allow users to register and save their progress 
* Add all coin locations for the Disney parks in Anaheim, California and Orlando, Florida
